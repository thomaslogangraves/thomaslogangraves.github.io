<h1>Why Go Traveling?</h1>
<p>Most people could stay at home and save money. It's also generally safer to stay at home than to travel. So why do it? I would describe it an necessary part of becoming an adult. Now, it's important to mention when I am talking about travel I don't mean anything other than leaving your hometown area to explore somewhere new. By this definition most people have gone traveling to some extent or another. That is the wonderful thing about traveling, it can be a short or a long journey.</p>
