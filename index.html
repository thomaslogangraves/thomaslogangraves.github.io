<h1>Why Go Traveling?</h1>
<p>Most people could stay at home and save money. It's also generally safer to stay at home than to travel. So why do it? I would describe it an necessary part of becoming an adult. Now, it's important to mention when I am talking about travel I don't mean anything other than leaving your hometown area to explore somewhere new. By this definition most people have gone traveling to some extent or another. That is the wonderful thing about traveling, it can be a short or a long journey.</p>

<p>Another site that tells you about different areas and where to travel is <a href="http://www.fodors.com/">Fodors.</a> Take at look if you are interested in other information about traveling. <b>Assignment:</b> This website uses a lot of divisions and id's in order to either use javascripting or to change the formatting. However, there are far amount of image elements linked to pictures. I think the site does a great job of visually inticing the user. However, the sheer amount on the first page seems a bit overwhelming at first.</p>
